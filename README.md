# Wildlife Image Classification Using Multiple Pre-Trained Models

This repository contains a project that demonstrates the use of multiple pre-trained models—MobileNetV2, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0—for classifying images of various wildlife species. The project is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Overview

In this project, we explore the application of transfer learning using four different pre-trained models to perform image classification on a dataset of wildlife images. The models used are MobileNetV2, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0. Each model is fine-tuned for the specific task, and their performances are compared to identify the most effective model for this classification problem.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images of various wildlife species, categorized into multiple classes. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the performance of the models.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open the wildlife2-3-3-3.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.
Execute the cells to load the dataset, build the models, train, and evaluate them.


Model Training and Evaluation:

The notebook trains four different models—MobileNetV2, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0. 
Each model's performance is evaluated on the validation dataset, and the results are compared.

Customizing the model:

1. Change the Base Model: You can easily swap out the base model (e.g., ResNet50) for another pre-trained model provided by TensorFlow/Keras.
2. Modify the Architecture: Add, remove, or alter the layers added on top of the base model to better suit your specific classification task.
3. Adjust Hyperparameters: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, dropout rates, and other hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
4. Implement Custom Preprocessing: Modify the preprocessing steps or data augmentation techniques to better align with your dataset's characteristics.
