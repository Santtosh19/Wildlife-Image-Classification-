# Wildlife-Image-Classification-
This project demonstrates the application of multiple pre-trained models—MobileNetV2, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0—for classifying images of various wildlife species. The project leverages the power of transfer learning to efficiently classify images into multiple categories, using TensorFlow and Keras.
